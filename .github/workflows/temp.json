This prevents reporting issues. Contributed by Mateus Berardo de Souza Terra in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/433\">#433</a>.</li>\n<li>Improved sample projects (from the <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/tree/master/examples\">examples</a> directory) to support running tox -e pyXY. Now the example configures a suffixed coverage data file, and that makes the cleanup environment unnecessary. Contributed by Ganden Schaffner in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/435\">#435</a>.</li>\n<li>Removed the empty console_scripts entrypoint that confused some Gentoo build script. I didn't ask why it was so broken cause I didn't want to ruin my day. Contributed by Michał Górny in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/434\">#434</a>.</li>\n<li>Fixed the missing <a href=\"https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contexts.html\">coverage context</a> when using subprocesses. Contributed by Bernát Gábor in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/443\">#443</a>.</li>\n<li>Updated the config section in the docs.
